# Website
Game community website I created when running a Counter-Strike server from home.

There were many plans to expand on the website further. Including adding a server list when I began to open more servers. There was also a plan to create a forum from scatch. I however ended up moving and stopped hosting the server. All that is left is the design which I think looks quite nice and does a good job at scaling based on screen size. The discord join button goes to a discord that no longer exists but could be replaced with any discord webhook.

If you wish to see a live version of the website without hosting the code yourself head over to: https://dbevan770.github.io/website/

# What if I Want to Host the Website with Node.js?

The website has a javascript backend hosted with Node.js. The live version of the website runs from the live branch where all of the paths are just static to the locations of each html page and css. If you wish to build the website and run it through node download the main branch instead where the backend is still in tact. I had to make alterations in the live branch to make it work properly and as such it will not work without adjustments in Node.
