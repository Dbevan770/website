# Website
Game community website I created when running a Counter-Strike server from home.

There were many plans to expand on the website further. Including adding a server list when I began to open more servers. There was also a plan to create a forum from scatch. I however ended up moving and stopped hosting the server. All that is left is the design which I think looks quite nice and does a good job at scaling based on screen size. The discord join button goes to a discord that no longer exists but could be replaced with any discord webhook.

The javascript back end is hosted with Node.js this does not work on the github live version. In order to make it work in Node you will need to make a few changes.

# View a Live Version of the Website
If you wish to see a live version of the website without hosting the code yourself head over to: https://dbevan770.github.io/website/

Let me know what you think of this basic website.
