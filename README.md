# website
Game community website I created when running a Counter-Strike server from home.

There were many plans to expand on the website further. Including adding a server list when I began to open more servers. There was also a plan to create a forum from scatch. I however ended up moving and stopped hosting the server. All that is left is the design which I think looks quite nice and does a good job at scaling based on screen size. The discord join button goes to a discord that no longer exists but could be replaced with any discord webhook.
